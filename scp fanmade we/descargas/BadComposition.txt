I hear a very strange song
going in there could be wrong
And it's not what we think.
It's blood, not natural cherry ink
It is a trap.
It is an old musical score.
Can this really save my life?
if you don't resist
Then you'll cut your own wrist
then you will finish it
Until you collapse.

It's a bad composition
Demanding Completion
It will try to control you
As he did with other victims too
It's a bad composition
Demanding completion.

It's a bad composition
Get away, It will try to control you
Like his other victims
you will cut your own wrist
And you will finish the composition
You will collapse, but the composition will end
You won't be able to touch it, you won't be able to play it either
But the finished Composition is going to be
It's a bad composition
It's a bad composition
Demanding completion
a paragraph with notes
It wasn't natural ink, it was blood
It will try to control you, and when you finish the composition
You are not going to interpret it, it is going to wait for more victims
It's a bad composition
